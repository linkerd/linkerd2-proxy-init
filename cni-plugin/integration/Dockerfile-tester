# A single container holds all of the test code and it must be
# specified in `run.sh` which tests you want to run.
#
# There's no ENTRYPOINT as integration test runners will require
# two things:
#  1) a specific k3d cluster configured with CNI
#  2) a test suite (e.g. `flannel.go`) runs with a configured CNI plugin.
